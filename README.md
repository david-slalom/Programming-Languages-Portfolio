# Programming-Languages-Portfolio

This project creates an investment console application in C++ to demonstrate knowledge of user input and out put with a menu based selection. 

One thing well done in the application is the minimal use of the Main Function in the program, only calling a singular function for the entire program to work effectivly.

Ehancements: The functions creating the menu and managing the variuables through input could be adjusted, also I could have utilized data structures and classes to make it a much more robust application 

Not much of this project was challenging. 

Input output, small main method, and managing variables;

I used component based implementation of the function making ti fairly customaizable.
